		This is an engineering course project, done by a group of people no one’s heard of... yeah, I know you don’t care, 
		but since you’re reading this you might actually enjoy wasting time, so by all means you’re welcome to read our 
		official documents too!  
	</p>
	<p>
		Formalities aside, this is also a game, a research work, 
		and a possibly-future-business-breakthrough-...thing.  
	</p>
	<p>
		You see, there’s this problem categorized 
		as the “Travelling Merchant”. It’s very complex, no machine to this day has ever solved it perfectly. 
		The Travelling Merchant problem is a conundrum in which you have to find the best path from one point to another, 
		or through all points using the shortest route. It may come in many forms and scenarios, and if complex enough, 
		the ways of solving it are countless! That’s why computers can’t find the best solutions, and it’s a darn shame, 
		because those solutions have real-life implications.  
	</p>
	<p>
	You, however, may be able to find a better solution 
	than a computer. You may not be aware of it, but your brain contains more processing power than all of 
	United States’ computers combined (and estimately several petabytes of memory! you can read about it here), 
	so I definitely believe you‘re up to the challange. There are many things humans can do that computers can’t 
	(including recognizing human emotions, inventing new patents, expressing individual creativity, socializing, 
	learning from others...).  
	</p>
	<p>
	So you see, it’s possible for you to replace a computer, or as we call it, 
	“Breaking the Code”. Why? Well, first it‘s a life-sized achievement. How many people can say they beat 
	a computer in a thinking game? Besides, I’m sure you‘ll get fame for such a feat. And it’s also a fun game, 
	see for yourself. Please let others see so too :D How? Think, be creative, learn from others, use your imagination, 
	learn from mistakes, or just do what feels right! 	You can also check out others’ solutions, 
	or learn the concept itself, to get a better approach. Just press the apropriate links, it‘s already there 
	for your convenience, I know how lazy you’re. Heck, we go way back, I know you for 2 minutes already :) 
	When? Right now! Give it a try! Lets start some code breaking, or fail and have fun trying! 
	</p>
	<p> 
	...Why are you still here?!?! Go try the game thing. Oh, you’re here for the solutions? 
	Trying to improve a system/network of sorts? Sure, we may have a good pattern for you, or could help you get one, 
	please contact us. We’d love to help making your business more effective. All we’d ask for is a small slice of 
	the profits/savings you’d get by using our product.
