			<p>This is an engineering course project, done by a group of
				people no one heard of... yeah, I know you don't care, but since
				you're reading this you might actually enjoy wasting time, so by all
				means you're welcome to read our official documents too!</p>
			<p>Formalities aside, this is also a game, a research work, and a
				possibly-future-business-breakthrough-...thing.</p>
			<p>You see, there's this problem categorized as the Travelling
				Merchant. Its very complex, no machine to this day has ever solved
				it perfectly. The Travelling Merchant problem is a conundrum in
				which you have to find the best path from one point to another, or
				through all points using the shortest route. It may come in many
				forms and scenarios, and if complex enough, the ways of solving it
				are countless! Thats why computers can't find the best solutions,
				and its a darn shame, because those solutions have real-life
				implications.</p>
			<p>You, however, may be able to find a better solution than a
				computer. You may not be aware of it, but your brain contains more
				processing power than all of United States computers combined (and
				estimately several petabytes of memory! you can read about it here),
				so I definitely believe your'e up to the challange. There are many
				things humans can do that computers can't (including recognizing
				human emotions, inventing new patents, expressing individual
				creativity, socializing, learning from others...).</p>
			<p>So you see, it's possible for you to replace a computer, or as
				we call it, Breaking the Code. Why? Well, first it's a life-sized
				achievement. How many people can say they beat a computer in a
				thinking game? Besides, I'm sure you'll get fame for such a feat.
				And its also a fun game, see for yourself. Please let others see so
				too :D How? Think, be creative, learn from others, use your
				imagination, learn from mistakes, or just do what feels right! You
				can also check out others solutions, or learn the concept itself,
				to get a better approach. Just press the apropriate links, it's
				already there for your convenience, I know how lazy you're. Heck, we
				go way back, I know you for 2 minutes already :) When? Right now!
				Give it a try! Lets start some code breaking, or fail and have fun
				trying!</p>
			<p>...Why are you still here?!?! Go try the game thing. Oh,
				you're here for the solutions? Trying to improve a system/network of
				sorts? Sure, we may have a good pattern for you, or could help you
				get one, please contact us. We'd love to help making your business
				more effective. All we'd ask for is a small slice of the
				profits/savings you'd get by using our product.</p>
